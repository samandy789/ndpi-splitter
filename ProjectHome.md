This project contains 2 applications.

**NDPI Splitter**: this is a Java & SWT application for converting .NDPI files (produced by a Hamamatsu Nanozoomer Microscope) into smaller TIFF segments for further processing. It also includes the option to have empty images separated out from interesting ones.

**Snapshot Creator**: this is a Java based batch process which creates reduced resolution snapshots from .NDPI files and prepares them for display using the Deep Zoom library.

To use this software the Hamamatsu SDK must be obtained separately from the Hamamatsu Corporation under their licensing agreement.

This software was developed by Intersect Australia as part of an ANDS-funded data capture project for the University of Sydney.
